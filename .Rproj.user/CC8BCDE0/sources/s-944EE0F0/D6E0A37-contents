# Introduction

## Introduction 
<div class="black">
- Formal marriage or informal union
- Under 18 years 
- Each year, 12 million girls  
- Nearly 1 girl every 2 seconds and 1 in every 5 girl
- Huge challenges 
- Middle East to Latin America, South Asia to Europe

## Child Marriage in Myanmar
<div class="black">
- 2%  - by 15 years
- 16 % - by 18 years
- Under-addressed
- Women and girls in Myanmar have few rights 
- Varying minimum age requirements for marriage
- Marriages are often arranged or influenced by parents, families, and community members.
- Females in rural areas often marry early, between the ages of fourteen and seventeen. 
- Divorce, it is relatively infrequent

## Gender inequality?
<div class="black">
No study that investigated the association of age of first marriage with gender inequality in Myanmar.

## Objective 
<div class="black">
**To investigate the association between age at marriage and gender equality.**

# Methods

## Data
<div class="black">
**Data set**: Demographic health survey from 2015-2016 in Myanmar.

**Primary factor**: Difference in the highest educational year between women and their husbands

**Other factors**: Residence, Wealth Index, Educational level of women and their husbands, Difference in age between them

      * Residence: Rural or Urban  

      * Educational level: No education, Primary, Secondary or Higher

      * Wealth Index: Poorest, Poorer, Middle, Richer or Richest

## Statistical Analysis
<div class="black">
- Multiple linear regression analysis

- Dependent Variable: "age at First marriage"

- Independent Variables: Difference of highest educational year and age, individual educational level , wealth index, rural area

- P-value < 0.05 was considered as significant

- Software: R (version 3.2.2.)

## Wealth index
<div class="black">
<div class="red2">**Higher than "middle"** class was associated with **low marriage age** </div>  


- Arranged marriage by parents

- Financial issue for tuition

- Lack of reprocutive health knowledge

- Drop out secondary to early birth

## Gender inequality
<div class="black">
<div class="red2">**Difference in age and education** **reduced** age at marriage of women.</div>  


- Men who have musculine ideologies prefer younger wife

- Male-dominated education 

[@sandoy2016effectiveness][@rumble2018empirical][@kidman2016child]

## Limitation

- Cross sectional study design

- Missing values

- Potential other confounders

# Conclusion
## Conclusion
<div class="black">
The difference in the highest educational level between women and their husbands were associated to age at first marriage in women in Myanmar in addition to factors of individual educational level, wealth index and age difference between them.
